  "Content: 🤯 ChatGPT will now be personalized for everyone!\n\nOpenAI has just announced a much-needed update for ChatGPT.\n\nOne hallmark of human conversations is that we remember the context from previous conversations, understand the human we are conversing with, and speak accordingly.\n\nNot having a broad memory has been a problem with chatbots like ChatGPT.You may have had hundreds of conversations with ChatGPT, but you have to give context to the LLM every time you start a new chat.\n\nWhat if ChatGPT could remember important details from every chat, like \"you work as a Product Manager,\" or \"you prefer meeting summaries in bullet points,\" or \"you love traveling\"?By having knowledge of these details, ChatGPT can give you curated responses without you having to mention details every time explicitly!\n\nWith this new update, ChatGPT can give personalised responses for every user.\n\nP.S. This feature is not widely available for everyone yet. You can go to \"Settings > Personalization > Memory\" to check if you have access.\n\nP.P.S. This seems closely inspired by an open-source project named MemGPT, which did amazing work in memory management in an unbounded context.",

It's like having a dedicated chatbot just for you.\n\nTweet 4:\nNot everyone has access to this remarkable update yet. To see if you're among the lucky ones, head to \"Settings > Personalization > Memory.\"\n\nTweet 5:\nCredit where credit's due!
